# Installation
Download the executable and place it where you want to have it.
<h4>(<span style="color: red"><strong>WARNING FOR WINDOWS</strong></span>)<h4>
Upon opening the application it registers it's current location for the `nxm:` protocol in regedit.<br>
There is a way to update that location in the settings.

# Usage
<strong>This does not currently support managing mods in other ways aside from the Nexus `Mod Manager Download` Button, but it will be available soon</strong><br>
Stardew Mod Manager registers with the `nxm:` protocol from NexusMods meaning that you can install a mod easily by pressing the `Mod Manager Download` button.<br>
This also extends to SMAPI, it is capable of automatically installing and uninstalling it.<br>

You can enable and disable mods at will by double clicking on them in the list or right clicking them.<br>
Mods can also be deleted from the right click context menu.
